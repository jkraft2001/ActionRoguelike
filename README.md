Course content completed using Unreal Engine 5.2.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code.

I will be updating the READ.ME as needed and outlined as I progress through the course.

I am using Epic Game's assets to complete the course content. Details are below.
Game Assets: Licensed for use with the Unreal Engine only. Without a custom license you cannot use to create sequels, remasters, or otherwise emulate the original game or use the original gameâ€™s trademarks, character names, or other IP to advertise or name your game. (Unreal Engine EULA applies) (Please note this applies to the Game Assets that refer to Epic's Paragon, you can still use the project code and content to build your own Unreal Engine game)
